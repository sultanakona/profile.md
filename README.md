# About Me — Sultana Parvin Kona

I am Sultana Parvin Kona, an enthusiastic and results-oriented Computer Science student with a strong focus on Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. I enjoy extracting meaningful insights from real-world data and turning those insights into predictive models and practical solutions. I believe in writing clean, reusable, and scalable code, and I take ownership of every project I work on.

## Education & Current Focus
- Pursuing B.Sc. in Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) at Bangladesh University of Business & Technology (BUBT).
- Actively advancing skills in Machine Learning and Deep Learning, with hands-on practice across supervised and sequence models.

## Technical Skills
- Machine Learning & Deep Learning: Regression, Classification, Random Forest, XGBoost, LSTM, CNN, sequence-to-sequence models
- Programming & Libraries: Python, NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch
- Data Workflows: Data cleaning, preprocessing, feature engineering, model evaluation, visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Natural Language Processing: Text preprocessing, embeddings, basic neural machine translation approaches
- Web & Mobile (basic): React, React Native
- DevOps & Tools (beginner): Docker, Git, environment & dependency management

## How I Work
- Problem-driven: I focus on understanding the core problem first, then design pragmatic, data‑driven solutions.
- Iterative delivery: I build rapid prototypes, validate hypotheses, and refine models toward production readiness with attention to reproducibility and performance.
- Code quality & documentation: I prioritize readable code, testing, and clear documentation so teams can onboard quickly and maintain momentum.
- Team collaboration: I communicate clearly, contribute proactively, and take responsibility for delivering value on time.

## What I Offer
- Practical Machine Learning experience and a continuous learning mindset.
- Ownership of features and projects with a focus on measurable outcomes.
- Willingness to contribute to open source and learn from peers.

## Let's Work Together
I enjoy taking on challenging problems and turning ideas into functioning solutions. If you have a project or opportunity where I can contribute, I’m eager to discuss ideas, prototype solutions, and deliver impact quickly.
