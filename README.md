## About Me 

I am Sultana Parvin Kona, an enthusiastic and results-focused Computer Science student with a strong interest in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. I enjoy extracting meaningful insights from data and transforming those insights into predictive models and practical solutions. I believe in writing clean, reusable, and scalable code, and I take full ownership of the projects I work on.

I am currently pursuing a B.Sc. in Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) at Bangladesh University of Business & Technology (BUBT). I am actively building expertise in the following areas:

- Machine Learning & Deep Learning: Regression, Classification, Random Forest, XGBoost, LSTM, CNN, sequence-to-sequence models  
- Python programming and libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Scikit‑Learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch  
- Data workflows: Data cleaning, preprocessing, feature engineering, model evaluation, and visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn)  
- Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Neural Machine Translation techniques  
- Frontend & Mobile (basic): React, React Native  
- Containerization & tooling (beginner): Docker, Git, environment management

I enjoy taking ownership of large projects, working actively within teams, and preparing clear documentation to help teammates onboard quickly. I am eager to take on new challenges and contribute to open source.

Let’s solve real problems together — I’m ready to discuss ideas, build prototypes, and deliver rapid, valuable results.
